Bammy is an AI code reviewer for GitHub pull requests and GitLab merge requests.
Connect repositories, choose a model provider or Ollama, and run manual or
automatic reviews with inline findings, walkthroughs, and commit statuses. The
dashboard tracks reviews and findings across runs.

> [!WARNING]
> **Bammy is alpha software.** Features and configuration may evolve. AI findings
> need human verification and can miss problems or report false positives. The
> included Docker setup is for development, not public production hosting.

## Highlights

- **Self-hosted, bring your own model:** Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, a compatible
  proxy on a [custom host](#llm-connections-and-custom-endpoints), or a local
  [Ollama](#ollama) model.
- **GitHub and GitLab:** a GitHub App, plus GitLab.com or self-hosted GitLab.
- **Reviews where you work:** inline findings with suggestions, one summary
  comment, and a `bammy/review` commit status.
- **Manual or automatic:** submit a PR/MR URL, review on webhooks, or comment
  `/bammy review`.
- **Per-repository config:** dashboard settings, overridable by a
  [`.bammy.yaml`](#review-configuration) in the repository.
- **Findings across runs:** a later run never posts the same finding twice.
  Ignore findings as false positives, intentional, or fix later, and track the
  false-positive rate on the dashboard.

## Quick start

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rdlugs/bammy.git && cd bammy
cp .env.example .env
# set JWT_SECRET and ENCRYPTION_KEY in .env, each with: openssl rand -hex 32
docker compose up --build
```

Open http://localhost:5173, register, then follow
[Run your first review](#run-your-first-review). The full setup is in
[Getting started](#getting-started).

## How it works

The `worker` container runs review jobs: it fetches the PR/MR, resolves the review configuration, sends the diff to the configured model in one or more passes (plus an optional walkthrough), validates the findings and stores the result on the job. Model keys come from `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`, unless the repository owner has stored their own. The worker polls the `review_jobs` table (claimed with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, so several workers can run side by side); tune it with `WORKER_POLL_INTERVAL_MS`, `WORKER_CONCURRENCY`, `WORKER_LOCK_TIMEOUT_MS` and `WORKER_MAX_ATTEMPTS`.

## Getting started

Requires Docker with Compose.

```sh
cp .env.example .env
# set JWT_SECRET and ENCRYPTION_KEY, each with: openssl rand -hex 32
# keep NODE_ENV=development for the local HTTP setup
docker compose up --build
```

The initial command builds the client and server dependency images. For subsequent
starts, use `docker compose up`. Source changes are bind-mounted into the containers
and picked up by the development watchers without rebuilding. Rebuild the images
when either `package.json` or `package-lock.json` changes.

- Web client: http://localhost:5173 (`CLIENT_HOST_PORT`)
- API: http://localhost:4000/api (`API_HOST_PORT`); the client proxies `/api` to it
- Postgres: localhost:5433 (`DB_HOST_PORT`)

If you change `CLIENT_HOST_PORT`, update `CLIENT_ORIGIN` to match.

Migrations are applied automatically when the `server` container starts.

Check startup without opening a browser:

```sh
curl --fail http://localhost:4000/api/health
```

Use your configured `API_HOST_PORT` if it differs. A ready API returns
`{"status":"ok"}`. The database lives in a persistent Docker volume; rebuilding
images does not delete it.

### Docker runtime environment

Set `NODE_ENV` in `.env`; the API and worker both use it, defaulting to
`development` when omitted or empty. Recreate affected services after changing it:

```sh
docker compose up -d server worker
```

| Value | API and worker behavior |
| ----- | ----------------------- |
| `development` | Local HTTP authentication cookies; local/private forge hosts are allowed. |
| `production` | Secure authentication cookies, and existing HTTPS/public-address checks for self-hosted forge hosts. Use an HTTPS client origin. |

`test` is reserved for automated tests; the server test script sets it explicitly.
Other values fail startup validation. `production` does not switch Docker
commands, disable watchers, build/serve the frontend, or provide HTTPS. The client
still runs Vite's development server. Production deployment infrastructure is
deferred; do not expose this Compose setup publicly.

### Users and invites

The first account registered on an instance becomes its **admin**, and so does
the oldest account on an install that predates roles. Admins see **Users** in the
sidebar, where they can promote or demote admins, remove users and create invite
links. An instance always keeps at least one admin. Each user's connections,
repositories and reviews stay private to them; being an admin does not grant
access to them.

`REGISTRATION_MODE` in `.env` controls who can create an account:

| Value | Who can register |
| ----- | ---------------- |
| `open` (default) | Anyone who can reach the client |
| `invite` | Only people with an invite link from an admin |
| `closed` | Nobody; admins can still create invites, but they cannot be used until the mode allows them |

An invite link works once and expires after 7 days. Adding an email limits the
link to that address. When `SMTP_URL` (for example
`smtp://user:pass@smtp.example.com:587`) and `MAIL_FROM` are set, the link is
also emailed; otherwise copy it from the dialog, which shows it only once.

### Run your first review

1. Open the client URL and register an account. The first account is the admin.
2. In **LLM Connections**, add and verify a model provider key, or configure
   [Ollama](#ollama). External providers may charge for model usage.
3. In **Configuration**, select that connection and a model available to it.
4. In **Repositories**, connect GitLab or install your configured GitHub App using
   the [forge setup](#forge-connections), then add a repository for review.
5. In **Reviews**, submit the URL of an open PR/MR on that repository. The worker
   processes it and the detail page shows results or the reason it failed.

Default publishing can post comments and statuses and update the description.
For an initial evaluation, use a test repository or disable publishing in
Configuration before running the review. Manual reviews do not require an
internet-reachable webhook URL; automatic reviews do.

See the [synthetic review output fixture](server/tests/__snapshots__/review.md)
for a rendered markdown example. It exercises presentation and is not a real
review or evidence of model accuracy.

### Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary>Common setup and review problems</summary>

- **Startup validation fails:** set a JWT secret of at least 32 characters and
  an encryption key of exactly 64 hexadecimal characters. Generate each with
  `openssl rand -hex 32`. Keep the encryption key stable for existing credentials.
- **A port is occupied:** change the corresponding host port in `.env`; changing
  the client port also requires updating `CLIENT_ORIGIN`.
- **Login fails after switching to production:** production cookies require
  HTTPS. Use `development` for the supplied local HTTP setup.
- **GitHub connection is unavailable:** configure the complete GitHub App setup,
  including OAuth installation confirmation.
- **Manual reviews work but automatic ones do not:** check webhook reachability,
  forge permissions, and trigger settings. GitLab hook creation needs Maintainer.
- **A model endpoint is unreachable:** inside Docker, `localhost` refers to the
  container. Use `host.docker.internal` for a service on the host and check its
  listen address and firewall.
- **Database tests cannot find `bammy_test`:** the Postgres init script runs only
  when the database volume is first initialized. An older volume may need an
  operator-created test database. Do not delete a volume containing needed data.
- **A review is failed or partial:** inspect its detail page and redacted
  `docker compose logs --tail 100 server worker` output for provider, permissions,
  or publishing errors. Never post credentials or private code in an issue.

</details>

## Forge connections

**GitLab**: connect with a personal, project or group access token with the `api` scope and at least Developer access. Self-hosted instances work by entering their host.

**GitHub**: create a GitHub App (Settings, Developer settings, GitHub Apps) and put its details in `.env`:

- Setup URL: `http://localhost:5173/api/connections/github/callback`, with **Request user authorization (OAuth) during installation** checked. Bammy uses that OAuth code to confirm the installing user can actually access the installation.
- Repository permissions: Pull requests (read and write), Contents (read), Commit statuses (read and write), Issues (read), Metadata (read). Issues is used for linked and related issues in the walkthrough; without it those parts are skipped with a warning.
- Copy the App ID, slug, client ID, a client secret and a generated private key into the `GITHUB_APP_*` variables.
- Webhook: URL `<API_PUBLIC_URL>/api/webhooks/github`, a secret in `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, and the events **Pull request**, **Issue comment** and **Installation**.

GitLab automatic reviews need a project webhook, which Bammy registers when a repository is enabled at `API_PUBLIC_URL`. That takes **Maintainer** access; with only Developer access the repository is enabled for manual reviews and the dashboard says why automatic ones are off. GitLab must be able to reach `API_PUBLIC_URL`; for local development use a tunnel.

In production, self-hosted forge hosts must use https and resolve to public addresses.

## Publishing to the forge

When a review starts, Bammy posts a "reviewing" summary comment and sets a pending `bammy/review` commit status. When it finishes it publishes, each step independently:

- **Inline comments** for actionable findings only (GitHub: one review posted as `COMMENT`, never approve or request changes; GitLab: one discussion per finding). Suggestions use each forge's suggestion syntax. Each comment carries a hidden fingerprint, so a later run never posts the same finding twice, even if Bammy's own records are lost.
- **The summary comment**, edited in place: the markdown served by `GET /api/reviews/:id/markdown`. One comment carries both what the change does (the walkthrough, when `output.walkthrough` is on) and what the review found. It ends with a line naming the commit, models and coverage, which `output.review_stats` turns off. With `output.post_summary` off, the walkthrough is posted as a comment of its own. `output.summary_location` is accepted but ignored, and a walkthrough block an earlier version wrote into the description is removed on the next review.
- **The walkthrough's optional parts**, each with its own switch: the review effort estimate (`output.estimate_effort`), a Mermaid sequence diagram of the main flow (`output.sequence_diagrams`), an assessment of how well the change addresses the issues it closes (`output.assess_linked_issues`; "fixes #12" style references on GitHub, GitLab's own closing issues on GitLab) and possibly related issues found by searching the tracker for the title's keywords (`output.related_issues`). Only issues the forge returned are ever shown.
- **The high-level summary** (`output.high_level_summary`): release notes by default, or whatever `output.high_level_summary_instructions` asks for. `output.high_level_summary_placement` puts it in the PR/MR description (the default, between hidden markers at the end, replaced on each run and never read back as the author's text) or in the walkthrough.
- **Labels**, when `output.blast_radius_label` or `output.effort_label` is on: the walkthrough's estimates as native labels such as `Large blast radius` or `10-20 Minutes`. A later run swaps a changed estimate's label. GitHub and GitLab only; on GitHub both labels and the cleanup of old description blocks use the Pull requests (write) permission.
- **The commit status**: `success` (pass), `failure` (blocked) or `error` (incomplete; GitLab shows it as `failed`), linking to the review in the dashboard. Branch protection can require it.

Turn the first three off with `output.post_inline`, `output.post_summary` and `output.post_check`, and the walkthrough with `output.walkthrough`. If publishing fails, the review is kept and the job is marked partial with the reason.

## Automatic reviews

- A PR/MR is reviewed when it opens, reopens, leaves draft or receives new commits. A commit that was already queued or reviewed is never reviewed again, so redelivered webhooks are harmless, and a newer push supersedes a review still waiting in the queue.
- Comment `/bammy review` on a PR/MR to ask for a review of its current head. Only people who can push (GitHub owners, members and collaborators; GitLab Developer or above) can.
- `triggers.review` picks what is reviewed automatically when it opens, reopens or leaves draft: `manual` (nothing), `published` (the default, drafts skipped) or `all`. `triggers.review_on_push` decides whether new commits are reviewed again, and `triggers.command` turns `/bammy review` off.
- `triggers.summary` limits the walkthrough in automatic reviews: `published` (the default) or `manual`, which leaves it to requested reviews.
- Automatic reviews are skipped when the title contains a phrase in `triggers.ignore_titles` (ignoring case), the author or whoever pushed is in `triggers.skip_authors`, the change carries a label in `triggers.skip_labels` (exact and case-sensitive), or the source or target branch name contains an entry of `triggers.skip_source_branches` / `triggers.skip_target_branches`. A manual review or `/bammy review` is never skipped by these lists.
- All of this is checked by the worker with the full configuration, so a skipped review shows in the dashboard with the reason.
- Older settings keep their meaning: `triggers.on_push: false` reads as `review: manual` and `triggers.drafts: true` as `review: all`, unless the same layer sets `review`.
- Each user has at most `WORKER_USER_CONCURRENCY` reviews running at once, and a repository holds at most 10 queued.
- With `triggers.abort_on_close` (the default), closing or merging a PR/MR cancels its queued reviews, and a running review stops: the worker checks the change before it starts, every 15 seconds while it runs (aborting model calls in flight) and before publishing. A cancelled review publishes nothing and closes its pending commit status as `error`. The webhook decides on queued reviews from the dashboard settings; the worker uses the full configuration, repository file included.

The worker keeps a small in-memory cache of what a commit fixes: the repository config file at the base revision and the change's diff for a given base and head. Reruns of the same head skip those forge calls; titles, descriptions, labels and state are always read fresh. `review.disable_cache` turns it off. Set in the dashboard it covers every read; set in `.bammy.yaml` the diff is fetched again once the file has been read.

## Review configuration

Settings resolve in this order, highest first:

1. Overrides from whatever triggered the review
2. `.bammy.yaml` (or `.bammy.yml`; the first found wins, they are not merged) in the repository, read from the PR's **base** revision so a change cannot loosen its own review
3. Repository settings saved in the dashboard (ignored while the repository follows the global config, which is the default for new repositories)
4. The global config saved on the Configuration page, shared by all of a user's repositories
5. The selected profile: `balanced` (default), `fast`, `strict`, `security`
6. Built-in defaults

A field set explicitly in any layer beats the profile. An invalid repository file is ignored as a whole and reported as a warning; the review still runs. The file cannot hold API keys, tokens or endpoints.

### LLM connections and custom endpoints

Add and verify provider credentials in LLM Connections, then select one in Configuration > LLM. Global configuration requires a connection; a repository can inherit it or select another saved connection. The selection is a live reference, so replacing its key or changing its custom host updates every configuration that uses it.

A connection with a custom host sends every model call to that compatible proxy. The model's provider prefix still picks the request format (`openai/` uses chat completions), and the rest of the id is passed through as is, slashes and parentheses included. Without a custom host, every configured model must use the selected connection's provider.

For 9router, save its key and host under OpenAI in LLM Connections, select the OpenAI connection in Configuration > LLM, and use a model such as `openai/cx/gpt-5.6-sol(medium)`.

The worker runs in a container, where `localhost` is the container itself; `host.docker.internal` reaches a proxy running on the host.

### Ollama

Add Ollama under LLM Connections and enter its OpenAI-compatible base URL. For Ollama running on the Docker host, use `http://host.docker.internal:11434/v1`. The API key is optional. Select the Ollama connection in Configuration > LLM and use the `ollama/<model>` form, for example `ollama/qwen3`.

### `.bammy.yaml` reference

Every key is optional. Values shown are examples, not all defaults.

## Development

<details>
<summary>Stack</summary>

| Layer    | Tech |
| -------- | ---- |
| Client   | Vite, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui, React Router, TanStack Query, react-hook-form + zod |
| API      | Express 5, TypeScript (run with tsx), Prisma 7 (`@prisma/adapter-pg`), zod, argon2id, JWT in an httpOnly cookie |
| Database | PostgreSQL 17 |

**Why PostgreSQL over MySQL**

- Real `UUID`, `TIMESTAMPTZ` and `CITEXT` types (emails are case-insensitive at the database level).
- `JSONB`, arrays, full-text search and row-level security for future cloud features.
- Transactional DDL, so a failed migration rolls back cleanly.

</details>

### Tests

```sh
docker compose exec server npm test   # API tests against the bammy_test database
docker compose exec client npm test   # React component and routing tests
```

GitHub Actions also runs type checks, client lint, and the client production
build inside Docker. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the complete checks.

### Database changes

```sh
# edit server/prisma/schema.prisma, then:
docker compose exec server npx prisma migrate dev --name <change>
```

### Project layout

```
client/   React SPA (shadcn components live in src/components/ui)
server/   Express API (src/routes, src/controllers, prisma/schema.prisma) and the review worker (src/worker)
docker/   Postgres init script (creates the test database)
```
