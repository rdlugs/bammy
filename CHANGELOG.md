# Changelog

All notable changes to Sentryward are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
While Sentryward is pre-1.0, minor versions may include breaking changes.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Instance admins. The first account on an empty install becomes the admin (on
  an existing install, the oldest account does). Admins manage users from the
  **Users** page, promote or demote other admins, and create instance invites.
  An instance always keeps at least one admin.
- `REGISTRATION_MODE` (`open`, `invite` or `closed`) controls who can create an
  account. The first account is always allowed.
- Invite links that work once and expire after 7 days, optionally limited to one
  email. Tokens are stored only as hashes. With `SMTP_URL` and `MAIL_FROM` set,
  invites are emailed, and resending one rotates its link and renews its expiry.
- Team workspaces with their own forge connections, repositories, reviews,
  findings, global review config and LLM keys. Members have an `owner`, `admin`
  or `member` role: admins manage settings and members, and only owners grant,
  revoke or hold ownership. A team always keeps at least one owner.
- Team invites, accepted by existing users or used to register a new account,
  and adding existing accounts to a team directly from a searchable picker.
- A workspace switcher in the sidebar, a **Team** page (`/workspace`) with
  members, pending invites and settings, and a **User Management** sidebar group.
- Profile pictures, shown across the dashboard and in member lists.

### Changed

- **Bammy is now Sentryward**, with a new logo. Every identifier changed with the
  name and there are no fallbacks:
  - the repository config file is `.sentryward.yaml` (or `.sentryward.yml`);
    rename any `.bammy.yaml`.
  - the comment command is `/sentryward review`.
  - the commit status is `sentryward/review`; update branch protection rules
    that required `bammy/review`.
  - hidden comment markers are `<!-- sentryward:... -->`, so the first review of
    a PR reviewed before the rename posts a fresh summary and inline comments
    instead of editing the old ones.
  - the session cookie is `sentryward_token`, so everyone signs in again once.
  - the Docker Compose project and default Postgres user/database are
    `sentryward`, so a local install starts with a new, empty database volume.
- Existing connections, LLM keys and global review configs move into each user's
  new personal workspace, so nothing changes for single-user installs.
- API requests choose a workspace with the `x-sentryward-workspace` header. Without
  it they act on the caller's personal workspace, so existing scripts keep
  working. The GitHub App install link takes `?workspace=` instead.
- `WORKER_USER_CONCURRENCY` now limits running reviews per workspace rather than
  per user.
- Switching workspaces clears the dashboard's cached data, so nothing from one
  team shows in another.

### Security

- Deleting an account locks the team memberships involved, so two owners leaving
  at the same moment cannot leave a team without an owner.
- Adding a team member by email, and the add-member picker, show team admins
  which emails have accounts on the instance. This is deliberate, so existing
  users can be added in one step.

## [0.1.0-alpha.2] - 2026-10-05

### Security

- Forge requests now stay on the connection's own host. Pagination links and
  redirects that point elsewhere are refused, so a self-hosted forge can no
  longer steer the server, with its access token, to internal addresses that
  the production host check is meant to block.

### Added

- Rate limits for the API (600 requests per minute per user, or per address
  before sign-in) and for webhooks (300 per minute per address).

### Fixed

- Text containing backslashes before a pipe no longer loses characters in the
  summary comment's tables.

## [0.1.0-alpha.1] - 2026-10-05

First public alpha.

### Added

- Review engine: diff parsing, language detection, ignore globs, token-budgeted
  chunking, concurrent review passes, an optional walkthrough, finding validation,
  severity and verdict, and fingerprints that dedupe findings across runs.
- Review worker with a PostgreSQL-backed job queue, per-user concurrency limits,
  and stale-lock recovery.
- GitHub (via a GitHub App) and GitLab (including self-hosted) forge connections.
- Publishing to the forge: inline comments with suggestions, a single summary
  comment with agent prompts, and a `sentryward/review` commit status, each step
  independent.
- Review triggers: manual review by URL or from a picker of open changes, re-runs,
  webhooks, and `/sentryward review` comments.
- Layered review configuration: trigger overrides, `.sentryward.yaml` from the base
  revision, dashboard repository settings, profiles, and defaults, with per-field
  source tracking.
- Model providers Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google, plus custom endpoints and Ollama.
  LLM connections verify stored keys.
- Dashboard: home overview, reviews list, review detail with a live forge preview,
  repository and connection management, findings management, duration and
  false-positive stats, account settings, and a density setting.
- Markdown and JSON review output through the API.
- Open-source project files: MIT license, third-party notices, contributing guide,
  code of conduct, security policy, issue and pull request templates, and a
  Docker-based GitHub Actions CI workflow.

### Security

- Passwords are hashed with Argon2id. Authentication uses an httpOnly JWT cookie.
- Forge tokens, webhook secrets, and model API keys are encrypted at rest with
  AES-256-GCM.
- `NODE_ENV=production` enables secure cookies and HTTPS/public-address checks for
  self-hosted forge hosts.
- Dependency audit: server findings in the Prisma toolchain are fixed through npm
  overrides. Client findings in shadcn build tooling are accepted for this alpha
  (see [the release checklist](docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md)).

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for reporting vulnerabilities and deployment
boundaries.

### Known limitations

- Alpha software: features, configuration, and the API may change.
- AI findings need human verification and can miss problems or report false
  positives.
- The Docker Compose setup is for development, not public production hosting.
- Registration is open, with no invitation gate.
