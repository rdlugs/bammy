# Changelog

All notable changes to Bammy are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
While Bammy is pre-1.0, minor versions may include breaking changes.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0-alpha.2] - 2026-10-05

### Security

- Forge requests now stay on the connection's own host. Pagination links and
  redirects that point elsewhere are refused, so a self-hosted forge can no
  longer steer the server, with its access token, to internal addresses that
  the production host check is meant to block.

### Added

- Rate limits for the API (600 requests per minute per user, or per address
  before sign-in) and for webhooks (300 per minute per address).

### Fixed

- Text containing backslashes before a pipe no longer loses characters in the
  summary comment's tables.

## [0.1.0-alpha.1] - 2026-10-05

First public alpha.

### Added

- Review engine: diff parsing, language detection, ignore globs, token-budgeted
  chunking, concurrent review passes, an optional walkthrough, finding validation,
  severity and verdict, and fingerprints that dedupe findings across runs.
- Review worker with a PostgreSQL-backed job queue, per-user concurrency limits,
  and stale-lock recovery.
- GitHub (via a GitHub App) and GitLab (including self-hosted) forge connections.
- Publishing to the forge: inline comments with suggestions, a single summary
  comment with agent prompts, and a `bammy/review` commit status, each step
  independent.
- Review triggers: manual review by URL or from a picker of open changes, re-runs,
  webhooks, and `/bammy review` comments.
- Layered review configuration: trigger overrides, `.bammy.yaml` from the base
  revision, dashboard repository settings, profiles, and defaults, with per-field
  source tracking.
- Model providers Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google, plus custom endpoints and Ollama.
  LLM connections verify stored keys.
- Dashboard: home overview, reviews list, review detail with a live forge preview,
  repository and connection management, findings management, duration and
  false-positive stats, account settings, and a density setting.
- Markdown and JSON review output through the API.
- Open-source project files: MIT license, third-party notices, contributing guide,
  code of conduct, security policy, issue and pull request templates, and a
  Docker-based GitHub Actions CI workflow.

### Security

- Passwords are hashed with Argon2id. Authentication uses an httpOnly JWT cookie.
- Forge tokens, webhook secrets, and model API keys are encrypted at rest with
  AES-256-GCM.
- `NODE_ENV=production` enables secure cookies and HTTPS/public-address checks for
  self-hosted forge hosts.
- Dependency audit: server findings in the Prisma toolchain are fixed through npm
  overrides. Client findings in shadcn build tooling are accepted for this alpha
  (see [the release checklist](docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md)).

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for reporting vulnerabilities and deployment
boundaries.

### Known limitations

- Alpha software: features, configuration, and the API may change.
- AI findings need human verification and can miss problems or report false
  positives.
- The Docker Compose setup is for development, not public production hosting.
- Registration is open, with no invitation gate.
